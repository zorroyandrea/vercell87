                Greeting cards are great for designing your own birthday, thank you and holiday cards. Before writing your heart out, think of what shape, size and design you would like your card to have. We tried to use the heavier paper to give more stability to the image but the printer had trouble feeding it but the lighter weight paper works just fine.
    </p>

    <h3>Weight is important for many reasons.</h3>
    <p>Besides different greeting card sizes, we offer different sized greeting cards as well as different colors, weights, and textures of our cardstock, giving you total customization for your next. Text lighter than 59 lb. I was just wondering what sort of gsm people most expect or like for greeting cards and whether people would be happy with these as cards? Pick the right pound &amp; thickness for business cards, greeting cards, invitations.</p>
